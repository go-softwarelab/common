// Package seq provides a comprehensive set of utilities for working with sequences in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to offer a rich set of functions for creating, transforming, and consuming iter.Seq,
// enabling developers to work with collections of data in a functional programming style. The package includes
// utilities for filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting sequences, as well as combining and partitioning them.
//
// The package is designed to reduce boilerplate code and improve readability by providing a consistent API for
// common sequence operations. It leverages Go's type safety and generics to ensure that operations on sequences
// are both flexible and safe. The Sequence struct is worth mentioning explicitly, allowing method chaining and fluent
// composition of sequence operations.
