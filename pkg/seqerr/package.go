// Package seqerr provides specialized utilities for handling errors when working with iter.Seq in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to simplify error handling in sequence processing pipelines by offering functions
// that work with iter.Seq2 where the second value represents an error. These utilities automatically break iteration
// when an error is encountered and propagate it through the processing chain, allowing errors to be collected and
// handled at the end of the pipeline.
//
// The package includes error-aware versions of common sequence operations such as mapping, filtering, and reducing,
// enabling developers to write clean and robust sequence processing code without explicitly handling errors at each step.
// This approach reduces boilerplate code and improves readability by separating the error handling logic from the
// business logic.
//
// By integrating seamlessly with the iter.Seq ecosystem, this package provides a consistent way to manage errors
// across sequence operations, making it easier to build reliable data processing pipelines.
