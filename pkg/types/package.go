// Package types provides a collection of useful generic types and constraints
// for Go applications, enhancing type safety and enabling more expressive
// generic programming.
//
// This package includes generic constraint types that
// define sets of types usable with type parameters, such as numeric types,
// ordered types, or comparable types.
//
// It also includes utility types and structs like tuples or pairs, which simplify working with grouped data.
//
// The `types` package is designed to complement Go's type parameter features,
// making it easier to write reusable and type-safe code.
