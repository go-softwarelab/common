// Package slices provides a comprehensive set of utilities for working with slices in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to offer a rich set of functions for creating, transforming, and manipulating slices,
// enabling developers to work with collections of data in a functional programming style. The package includes
// utilities for filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting slices, as well as combining and partitioning them.
//
// The package is designed to reduce boilerplate code and improve readability by providing a consistent API for
// common slice operations. It leverages Go's type safety and generics to ensure that operations on slices
// are both flexible and safe. The functions in this package complement the standard library's slices package
// with additional functionality while maintaining similar patterns and conventions.
