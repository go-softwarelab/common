// Package to - provides a comprehensive set of utility functions for type conversion
// and transformation in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to offer useful, common converters and mappers that
// can be easily integrated into functional programming patterns, such as being used
// as mapper functions with the seq package.
//
// Key features include:
//
// - Type conversions between various numeric types (with proper range checking)
// - String formatting utilities (PascalCase, CamelCase, KebabCase, SnakeCase)
// - Boolean conversions from various sources
// - Pointer/value manipulation helpers
// - Conditional operators (If/Else, Switch/Case fluent APIs)
// - String manipulations (Words, Sentences, Capitalized, Ellipsis)
// - Range limiting functions (Clamped, NoLessThan, NoMoreThan)
//
// These utilities are designed to reduce boilerplate code and provide a consistent
// API for common transformation operations while maintaining type safety through
// generics.
