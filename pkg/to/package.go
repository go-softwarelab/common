// Package to provides a comprehensive set of utility functions for type conversion
// and transformation in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to offer useful, common converters and mappers that
// can be easily integrated into functional programming patterns, such as being used
// as mapper functions with the seq package.
//
// These utilities are designed to reduce boilerplate code and provide a consistent
// API for common transformation operations while maintaining type safety through
// generics.
