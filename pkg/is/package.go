// Package is provides a comprehensive set of predicates and validation functions
// for common conditional checks in Go applications.
//
// The goal of this package is to offer concise, reusable predicate functions that
// can be used for common validation scenarios, reducing boilerplate code and
// improving readability. The functions can be combined with other predicates
// using operators like Not() to create more complex conditions.
//
// These utilities are designed to be used in functional programming patterns
// and conditional logic while maintaining type safety through generics.
