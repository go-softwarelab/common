// Ordered is a constraint that permits any ordered type: any type
// that supports the operators < <= >= >.
// If future releases of Go add new ordered types,
// this constraint will be modified to include them.
//
// Note that floating-point types may contain NaN ("not-a-number") values.

// comparing a NaN value with any other value, NaN or not.
// See the [Compare] function for a consistent way to compare NaN values.

// Comparable is an interface that is implemented by all comparable types
// (booleans, numbers, strings, pointers, channels, arrays of comparable types,
// structs whose fields are all comparable types).
// The comparable interface may only be used as a type parameter constraint,
// not as the type of a variable.
