// Welcome to the `common` library by `go-softwarelab`! This library is designed to simplify your Go development experience by providing a set of common tools and utilities. Our goal is to turn complexity into clarity, making your everyday coding tasks easier and more efficient.
//
// One of the standout features of this library is its powerful set of functions that enhance the usability of Go iterators (`iter.Seq` and `iter.Seq2`). These functions are designed to make working with sequences in Go as seamless and pleasant as possible.
